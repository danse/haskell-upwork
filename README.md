This package includes bindings to the Application Programming
Interface (API) exposed by Upwork. The most valuable parts for me are:

- Authentication, as it took a while to get it right
- Data structures for job search results and job profiles, for example

My plan is to extend this package when me or other people need more
endpoints, or more properties from resulting JSON documents. Currently
the following endpoints are bound:

- auth
- job search
- job profile
- categories
